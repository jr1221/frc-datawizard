# frc-datawizard
A CLI application written in java to search the FRC API and organize their extensive data (from 2015+).  
FRC Data Wizard, which is unaffiliated with FIRST, accelerates what would be manual calls to an 
interactive menu that guides all options available with the inputted data points.
